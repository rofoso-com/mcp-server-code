# polopan mcp server

find clothes faster, deconstruct outfit photos with AI bounding boxes, check real-time size stock, get full occasion looks, and checkout in 1 click.

## what you can do

### 1. search by words or image
* **text search**: type what you want, like *"birthday dress under 3000"*, with instant size and price filters.
* **visual search**: upload a photo or share an image link to find identical or visually similar items.

### 2. deconstruct full outfit photos ("shop the look")
* upload any photo or influencer screenshot to detect individual pieces with bounding boxes (**Dress**, **Top**, **Bottom**, **Footwear**, **Bag**) and find exact catalog matches for each piece.

### 3. real-time size stock & pricing check
* verify whether a shopper's specific size is in stock right now, get live prices with discount %, shipping SLAs, and return policies before making a recommendation.

### 4. discover full looks by occasion
* get curated, coordinated outfits (outfit + footwear + bag + jewelry) styled for specific occasions: **Wedding**, **Cocktail**, **Party**, **Date Night**, **Club Night**, **Brunch**, and **Casual**.

### 5. direct 1-click checkout links (shopify checkout kit style)
* generate instant 1-click purchase URLs with pre-selected sizes and coupon codes so shoppers skip browsing and buy immediately.

### 6. find budget alternatives
* if a user likes a product but wants options matching their budget, discover visually similar alternatives in distinct price tiers.

## setup

### install in cursor (deeplink)

[![install mcp server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://polopan.com/mcp/cursor)

### recommended for uninterrupted connection: hosted mcp (no local Node)

add this to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

**canonical domain**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "polopan-products": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp-server.polopan.com/mcp",
      "headers": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**or direct Cloud Run URL**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "polopan-products": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://polopan-mcp-products-1040520402300.asia-southeast1.run.app/mcp",
      "headers": {}
    }
  }
}
```

save and reload Cursor.

### optional: local npm / npx (stdio)

if you prefer running the package on your machine:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "polopan-products": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "polopan-products-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

requires node.js 18+. if `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, clear stale npx cache: `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx/*` then run `npx` again.
